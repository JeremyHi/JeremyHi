                <h3>Gemini</h3>
                <p>
                  I have produced many pieces of work while at <a href="https://www.gemini.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a>. From smaller migrations to new services, to large scale implementations.of data pipelines, Compliance amangement tools, and highly distributed systems.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  My day to day involves working on the Identity team, which is a key component of Gemini's product operations. I work with stakeholders across the entire organziation to ensure proper user behavior, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence.
                  I lead projects to ensure the Identity service is always able to handle the massive scale of traffic, especially in a highly volatile environment such as a cryptocurrency exchange.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  One of my more recent projects has been a site wide user manangement service to facilitate user location based regulatory protocols. While the specifics of the product are more guarded, it effects every single new and existing user on the site, and its operations are critical to some of Gemini's key stakeholder management and company operations.

                  CEO of CryptoSym, a website that aimed to provide a safe environment for people to practice
                  trading cryptocurrencies on an exchange in real-time. Users can begin by trading with any
                  amount of money, ranging from $1 to $100,000. The website was aimed to
                  be a learning tool for people who are unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency markets and want to
                  practice with fake money. CryptoSym offered an initial tutorial on the real-world process of
                  transferring money from your bank account
                  to the exchange, creating a risk-free and informative environment for the users.

                  Participation in <a href="https://pollen.bcgdv.com/spotlight-digital-ventures-first-dappathon" target="_blank">BCG Digital Ventures First dAppathon</a> where over the course of 48
                  hours, developers broke into 20 teams, building
                  the best decentralized Apps (dApps) using blockchain technology. With prizes totaling $10k
                  and bragging rights of industry recognition. Our project was to build a complete financial
                  system for hotels to utilize the anonymity
                  of the blockchain network in order to provide guests with a faceless transaction and stay at
                  hotels.
