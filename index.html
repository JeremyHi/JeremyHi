    <p>
      Bool is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, and strongly-typed
      programming language influenced by Python and OCaml. Bool can be
      compiled to Javascript, does not use curly braces and semi-colons,
      is intuitive and readable, and so much more. Bool's simple, easy to
      learn syntax emphasizes readability, reducing the cost of program maintenance.
     </p>

    <p>
      Programmers will fall in love with Bool because of its similarity
      to Python and the productivity it provides. The original reason we decided
      to create Bool was to create a language that would allow programmers to
      have a similar "out-of-the-box," "plug-and-play" coding experience that
      each of us liked about Python. To make it more user-friendly, we decided
      to combine the safety and power of another favorite language, OCaml. The
      pattern-matching aspect of OCaml is an intuitive way of programming
      and with its compile-time analysis of programs, this rules out many
      programming errors. More precisely, this protects the integrity of the
      data manipulated by an OCaml program.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Bool, security is a high concern, and so we tried to adopt many of
      the same things that worked for the two parent languages that ensure some
      degree of protection and help for the programmer.
