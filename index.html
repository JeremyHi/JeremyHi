          dAppathon
        </strong>
      </h3>

      <p>
        The dAppathon was held August 25th-27th, at BCG Digital Ventures and DVolution,
        where they brought together some of the worldâ€™s most enterprising engineers to
        build the next wave of decentralized apps. My partner and I applied to compete
        in the tournament with hopes to expand and test our blockchain knowledge. Our
        application was accepted, and we were brought out to Manhattan Beach in Southern
         California to build for three days.
       </p>

      <p>
        Our project idea was to build a blockchain based, fully automated hotel management
        system, allowing customers of the hotel to book anonymously and assuredly, and hotel
         managers to reduce labor/resource costs. The flow of work went as followed:
         introduction and welcome to the event, we brainstormed and decided an idea by
         Friday night. On Saturday we coded the backend the entire day while beginning to
          work on the front end.
      </p>

      <p>
        While we did not win the tournament, we gained valuable knowledge about blockchain
        which ultimately inspired our senior project. It was a great experience, all the
        work can be found <a href="https://github.com/JeremyHi/dAppathon">here</a>.
