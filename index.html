                        <h3>— I'm Jeremy Hitchcock, a Backend Developer.</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have always been drawn to building architecture and making things work fast and
                            efficiently. I have a broad range of skills, from general backend using traditional REST
                            architecture with JAVA, to more modern approaches using Python to build smaller
                            applications through AWS Lambda and Databricks. I love building new projects from start to
                            finish, and ensuring that they are are built to last with the most modern approaches, and
                            take strong passion to reviving old architecture
                            into the best practices of today.

                                    I use Time Machine for my regular backups, but backup is a time and CPU consuming

                                    marvelous Time Capsule system, but it is expensive and it can be reproduced by a

                            trading cryptocurrencies on an exchange in real-time. Users can begin by trading with any
                            amount of money, ranging from $1 to $100,000. The website was aimed to
                            be a learning tool for people who are unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency markets and want to
                            practice with fake money. CryptoSym offered an initial tutorial on the real-world process of
                            transferring money from your bank account
                            to the exchange, creating a risk-free and informative environment for the users.
