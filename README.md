This is my personal site, where I display and explain various aspects about my work, hobbies, or whatever else comes to mind. You can find the various content laid out by category.

## __Featured Projects__

### __[Ethereum Twitter Updates](https://github.com/JeremyHi/Personal-Projects/tree/master/Ethereum_Twitter) (@Current_ETH)__

- Currently houses the `Python` files in which my _**@Current_ETH**_ Twitter account performs rudimentary coin analysis on price of Ethereum, then tweets information about said coin.
- Performs hourly, twelve hour, and under construction websocket analysis of Ethereum.
- The goal of this project was to increase my Python skillset, and begin dabbling into the algorithmic trading world.
The account got successful, and continues to gain followers every day.

### __[bool](https://teecolz.github.io/bool/)__

Bool is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, and strongly-typed programming language influenced by the languages of Python and OCaml. Bool comes with a plethora of benefits including the ability to be compiled to Javascript, the absence of curly braces and semi-colons, intuitive and simple readability, and so much more. Bool's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.

Often, programmers will fall in love with Bool because of its similarity to Python and the productivity it provides. The original reason we decided to create Bool was to create a language that would allow programmers to have a similar "out-of-the-box," "plug-and-play" coding experience that each of us liked about Python. To make it more user-friendly, we decided to combine the safety and power of another favorite language, OCaml. The pattern-matching aspect of OCaml is a really intuitive way of programming and with its compile-time analysis of programs, this rules out many programming errors. More precisely, this protects the integrity of the data manipulated by an OCaml program.

For Bool, security is a high concern, and so we tried to adopt many of the same things that worked for the two parent languages that ensure some degree of protection and help for the programmer.

### About

- Fluent in (Ordered most the least favorite): __Python__, __Javascript__, __Blockchain__, __Java__, __Web Development__
- I am currently working at [Vinfolio](https://vinfolio.com/) as an Engineering Intern, where I work full-stack on the website services. I have worked here for the past two years and have learned to use the following technologies:
  - Languages: __Java__, __JSP__, __Javascript__, __SQL__, __HTML__, and __XML__
  - Software: __IntelliJ__, __RazorSQL__, __Resin__, and __Apache-Ant__
- I attend Loyola Marymount University currently, where I am a Senior pursing my degree in Computer Science.
  - Particularly I have a strong interest in __Python__ and __Cybersecurity__, and have recently been working with [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/).
- After college I plan to work in the cybersecurity or system admin roles, as I have a passion for both fields.
  - Currently I have been doing lots of research into [Site Reliability Engineer](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor.html), and would be very interested in pursing a path to that role as well.
