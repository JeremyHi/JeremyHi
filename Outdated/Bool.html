  <p>
    Bool is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, and strongly-typed
    programming language influenced by Python and OCaml. Bool can be
    compiled to Javascript, does not use curly braces and semi-colons,
    is intuitive and readable, and so much more. Bool's simple, easy to
    learn syntax emphasizes readability, reducing the cost of program maintenance.
   </p>

  <p>
    Programmers will fall in love with Bool because of its similarity
    to Python and the productivity it provides. The original reason we decided
    to create Bool was to create a language that would allow programmers to
    have a similar "out-of-the-box," "plug-and-play" coding experience that
    each of us liked about Python. To make it more user-friendly, we decided
    to combine the safety and power of another favorite language, OCaml. The
    pattern-matching aspect of OCaml is an intuitive way of programming
    and with its compile-time analysis of programs, this rules out many
    programming errors. More precisely, this protects the integrity of the
    data manipulated by an OCaml program.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Bool, security is a high concern, and so we tried to adopt many of
    the same things that worked for the two parent languages that ensure some
    degree of protection and help for the programmer.
