        <h3>gemini</h3>
        <p>
          i have produced many pieces of work while at <a href="https://www.gemini.com" target="_blank">gemini</a>. from smaller migrations to new services, to large scale implementations of data pipelines, compliance management tools, and highly distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          my day to day involves working on the identity team, which is a key component of gemini's product operations. i work with stakeholders across the entire organization to ensure proper user behavior, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          i lead projects to ensure the identity service is always able to handle the massive scale of traffic, especially in a highly volatile environment such as a cryptocurrency exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          one of my more recent projects has been an overhaul of user kyc systems,
          moving from state-based to event-based architecture, giving users real-time updates system wide.
          this was a major undertaking, changing a large legacy system to a more manageable and scalable one.
          i wore both the hat of lead engineer and product manager for this project,
          working with stakeholders across the entire organization to ensure the project was successful.
