        <h3>gemini</h3>
        <p>
          i have produced many pieces of work while at <a href="https://www.gemini.com" target="_blank">gemini</a>. from smaller migrations to new services, to large scale implementations of data pipelines, compliance management tools, and highly distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          my day to day involves working on the identity team, which is a key component of gemini's product operations. i work with stakeholders across the entire organization to ensure proper user behavior, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          i lead projects to ensure the identity service is always able to handle the massive scale of traffic, especially in a highly volatile environment such as a cryptocurrency exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          one of my more recent projects has been a site wide user management service to facilitate user location based regulatory protocols. while the specifics of the product are more guarded, it effects every single new and existing user on the site, and its operations are critical to some of gemini's key stakeholder management and company operations.
